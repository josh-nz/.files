My dotfiles
===========

Clone and run `create-symlinks.sh`.
The basis of this script was borrowed [from here](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles/blob/master/makesymlinks.sh).
How I went about things was based on [this blog](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/).
